    <h2>About You</h2>
    <p>
    Hi Baby,  
    <br><br>
    Sometimes I just pause and think — I’m really lucky I met you. You’re not just kind, you're genuinely caring. The way you look out for people, even in small ways, really stands out. You don’t need to be loud or showy; your actions say enough.
    <br><br>
    You make things feel lighter. Whether we're talking or just being quiet, I always feel a little more okay when you're around. You might not notice it, but you have this calm and warmth that makes people feel safe — including me.
    <br><br>
    This is simple ra, I know. But I made it for you. Just something small to remind you that you matter — and if ever maabot ang days nga sad ka or ma-doubt nimo imong self, I hope this helps you remember: you are seen, you are appreciated, and you are loved more than you know.
    </p>
