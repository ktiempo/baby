    <h2>Why I Love You</h2>
    <p>
    I honestly can’t put into words the kind of love I have for you, bb.  
    All I know is — I love you. I don’t need a reason, and I don’t need to explain it.  
    <br><br>
    I love you for who you are. For just being you.  
    And even if you don’t always see it, I love you more than you know.  
    <br><br>
    This love has no doubts, no conditions — just something that stays, always.
